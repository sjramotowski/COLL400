# COLL400
Repository for my COLL400 project

Ramotowski_COLL400.pptx contains the slides I used to present in class
Ramotowski_COLL400_white.pptx is a version of my slides that uses a blank them, I extracted screenshots from this to use in my report

Coll400.ipynb contains the jupyter notebook that I created my models in. I commented out the k-fold function because it takes forever to run.
To run this notebook, it requires a directory called data which contains all of the data used in the project.

There are 12 csv files in data. The files that end in _test are the original length while those that end in _test2 are cut down to 2000 packets. 
I used the files that end in _test2 for my models
The ones that end with _validation are the data used to validate the models.
