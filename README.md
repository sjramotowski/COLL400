# COLL400
Repository for my COLL400 project

Ramotowski_COLL400.pptx contains the slides I used to present in class
Ramotowski_COLL400_white.pptx is a version of my slides that uses a blank them, I extracted screenshots from this to use in my report

Coll400.ipynb contains the jupyter notebook that I created my models in. I commented out the k-fold function because it takes forever to run.
To run this notebook, it requires a directory called data which contains all of the data used in the project.
